&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone who intends to operate as a mechanical engineer in industry, I will be forced to make ethical decisions throughout my career. These decisions will range in scope and impact, from an internal, personal level, to a public level, where lives could be in jeopardy. Throughout this class, we have discussed the range of impact and scope that engineering decisions can have, and how those impacts are often hidden at first glance. Further, to define those impacts requires an in-depth understanding of the cultural implications of engineering, as well as a strong understanding of how the facts of each situation have certain implications, and allow us to make certain assumptions with high certainty. Lastly, to define the causes of those impacts implies a level of investigation and deduction which requires explicit research and understanding of all parties involved.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Boeing MCAS system, and the accidents it caused, there were an enormous number of individuals involved who all contributed to the issue. This “collusion” can be attributed to personal interests as well as to somewhat unconscious company interests. These unconscious company interests can stem from culture, environment, reputation, etc, and can cause individuals to make decisions under the influence of extreme external pressure. Pressures such as the need for profit, the need to “rise the ranks” as an individual, and the need to maintain a “good reputation,” can all lead individuals to do things that in the long run end up being counterproductive. For example, there were individuals who noticed that MCAS could lead to catastrophic failures, but to protect themselves and their reputations, profits, etc, they chose to keep it a secret. However, in the end, the tragedies of the crashes ended up causing orders of magnitude more damage to those reputations, profits, etc.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the ASME Canons, the utmost importance should be placed on the health and safety of the public. Thus, the negligence of those responsible is both malicious in that it sought personal gain and entirely ineffective in that it caused the opposite to occur. Understanding that there will always be practical constraints, such as budgeting, timeline constraints, personnel constraints, and the countless other constraints of running a publicized business, it will always be a challenge to uphold values which prioritize the health and safety of the public, but the consequences of not doing so are significantly worse, and will completely nullify the effect of trying to make things easier for oneself by being negligent. In industry, I will always seek to ensure that my actions uphold a high ethical standard, to ensure that the work I am doing will have a positive impact on the world, rather than simply create value for shareholders.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless groups acting as stakeholders to any engineering endeavor, whether that be the public, those who have a monetary interest, or the individuals running the endeavor, so there will always be a need to consider all of the effects of each engineering decision.
