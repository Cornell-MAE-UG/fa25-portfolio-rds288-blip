For MAE 4272: Heat Transfer and Fluids Lab, I, along with a team of peers, designed a small windblade, with the intention making it maximally efficient. 

Overview:
My team was tasked with designing and testing a small (~6") windblade, for a small wind turbine, to be tested by us in the Fluid & Heat Transfer Lab at Cornell. 

Design Process:
We began by selecting the airfoil profile, then we wrote scripts to optimize the chord length and pitch angle at all points along the length of the blade. Once we had finished our initial design, we modeled the design in CAD, which was then 3D printed. Finally, we performed testing on the windblade, quantified its performance, and compared it to our initial analysis. 

Testing Summary:
We found that our blade produced significantly less power than we had predicted, likely due to some of the many assumptions we made during the initial design phase. 

My Contribution:
I modeled the windblade in CAD, and performed some of the efficiency calculations on our collected data.
