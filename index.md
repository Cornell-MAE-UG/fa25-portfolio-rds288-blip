## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Senior Mechanical Engineering Student at Cornell University, passionate about helping others and protecting the lives of those who are in danger. 

Through my time on the Cornell Baja Racing team, I have developed skills in mechanical design, analysis, and testing. I hope to apply these skills to a wide range of subjects, such that I can make as large of an impact as possible. 

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
